# Chimera

Description

## Installation


```bash
echo HELLO WORLD
```

## Usage

```python

import xyz

print("hello")
```

## TO-DO
-Save Perplex tab file directly into project folder

-Make Perplex tab reading faster maybe via parallelization

-Make coords and fields loading from stagyy faster

-Make K, G, rho extraction from tab files (based on geodynamic model P, T) faster using kdtrees

-Give option to compute seismic velocities using densities obtained either via 
tab file reading or stagyy
(curently only perplex available)

-Convert coordinates of velocity models to radial coordinates

-Compute seismic velocity anomaly

-Export to .sph file readable by axisem

-Complete readme file

-Make a package
